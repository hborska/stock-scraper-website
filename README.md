# Hot Stock Tracker (thetickerwatch.com)

## Website Link: www.thetickerwatch.com

This is a website I created to track which stocks are being talked about the most on social media. So far, I have implemented Reddit and Twitter. I have plans to implement more websites and interactions with more APIs in the future, along with many other new features.

The front end was created in React.js with axios for HTTP requests. The backend was created with NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. The web scrapers for both Reddit and Twitter were made in Python.
