# Hot Stock Tracker - The Ticker Watch

## Website Link: www.thetickerwatch.com

This is a website I created to track which stocks are being talked about the most on social media. So far, I have implemented Reddit. I have plans to implement more websites and interactions with more APIs in the future, along with many other new features.

The front end was created in React.js and the backend was created with NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. The web scraper was created with Python.
